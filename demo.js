Why do we need headers any idea?
everytime your going to make a request you want to  send something everytime when making request from front end to backend
for above problem header is used In header you can add what you want to send when make a request
example contenttype: application/json ou want to send everytime
header is used to send which are common
header is used for authentication 


common error we are going wrong are

axios request
           url ,{} ,methodtype

404 backend not understand what your saying
don't use special charater


What is axios?
axios is a tool to communicate from front end to server
front end  your laptop , server is cloud
axios is used for network call

What are the common problems faced when you make network calls and what should you do to solve it.
url is incorrectly chosen
 axios.post('url" ,(name:yash))
not stringy
send object correctly 
url  -- baseurl ==>flipkart.com/ 

                                        / getproducts =>  route some code behind the scenes
                                        /buyproducts
                                        /selproducts 


url -> baseurl/route



 open network tab and see what is wrong
endpoint has expired, what to do/
check the payload and the response tab
if you are not able to still find 2 problems are possible code problem or request problem
try whether it works with postman
no need of stringifying the payload ever
